## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first challenge I have completed using Tailwind CSS. I had done some tutorials previously that used Tailwind, but I needed try it on my own without any assistance. I had to look up the class names so it took me longer than if I had just used plain CSS. However, I wanted to challenge myself to apply a new skill to my work. 

### Continued development

I want to go back and refactor the code so I can clean up some of the classes that are reused alot. Since all of the cards are the same, I am thinking that I can create a single card class to apply all of these styles and make the HTML look cleaner.
